# FSU CIS 4930 CTF Write-Ups + Others

This is a collection of CTF write-ups from the FSU CIS4930 CTF class. Not all of my write-ups are included here. Write-ups will continue being added as they are being ported from .docx files to .md files.

Scripts and code are not included as bash entries in the Markdown files for the CIS4930 write-ups. They are included as screenshots, as I have lost access to the virtual machine containing all of my solutions and scripts. However, I still have the screenshots from the assignment write-ups.

If you are an FSU CTF TA and would like me to remove any of these write-ups from my public repository, please contact me at my email: ela22d@fsu.edu

# Write-ups are sorted by competition/class and problem type. This repository will continue being updated as I solve and complete more CTF Challenges.
